## Saara's portfolio
Here is a showcase of my competence. Some skills that I have learned in university and personal projects.

Hi, I'm ***Saara***! I'm Master's student in Biomedical Engineering and Health Technology from Turku. In my Master's I've decided to focus on Health Technology which contains a lot of data analysis, biosignals and machine learning. I have Materials Engineering minor in my Bachelor's. It has taught me a lot about properties of materials and Computer Aided Design especially with Creo. In my Masters's I have a minor in Robotics and Autonomous Systems. It in turn has taught me robotic perception, mapping and navigation, computer vision and sensor fusion and how to acquire data from different sensors and convert it for visualization and analysis.
