## My portfolio

Hi, I'm ***Saara*** 👩‍💻! I'm Master's student in Biomedical Engineering and Health Technology from Turku. In my Master's I've decided to focus on Health Technology which contains a lot of **data analysis**, **biosignals** and **machine learning**. I have Materials Engineering minor in my Bachelor's. It has taught me a lot about properties of materials and **Computer Aided Design** especially with Creo. In my Masters's I have a minor in Robotics and Autonomous Systems. It, in turn, has taught me **robotic perception**, **mapping and navigation**, **computer vision and sensor fusion** and how to acquire data from different sensors and convert it for visualization and analysis.

Here you can find some of my academic work mostly done in **Python**. Below I have explained more in detail what you can find and from where. I hope you have fun exploring my awesome codes or that you can find boost to your own coding!

### Academic work

#### EKG sleep apnea detection 🫀📈

This was a project work my friend and I did in our health technology project course. We did two projects on that course and this was my part. We got EKG data and were instructed to detect sleep apnea from it. This was very interesting project on biosignals, HRV metrics, and machine learning we have a lot of in our studies. It was a great opportunity to put my skills to use. Check out our workflow and conclusions!

#### Data exploratory, supervised learning and unsupervised learning data exercises 📊

These are all from the same course where we focused on data analysis and knowledge management. The first one is basic data exploration, categorization, visualization. The supervised learning exercises are k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) and Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and unsupervised focuses on principal componen analysis (PCA).

#### Evalution of LOOCV and LROCV, spatial LOOCV, and LOOCV of pairs 📉✅

These are from Evaluation of Machine Learning Methods course where we dived more deeply into machine learning methods and evaluated them in different cases. Here we mostly used LOOCV in different case but also Leave-replicas-out cross-validation.

#### My Bookshelf 📱📚

This was an interesting project where we were tasked to build a simple app using Android Studio. I decided to combine this project with my reading hobby and decided to make an app to track your bookshelf and rate the books you read. Inside the folder you can find a [text file](https://github.com/SaaraMa/portfolio/blob/main/Academic%20work/MyBookshelf/MyBookshelf_video.txt) where is a link to a video where I show how the app works.
