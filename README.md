## My portfolio

Hi, I'm ***Saara***! I'm Master's student in Biomedical Engineering and Health Technology from Turku. In my Master's I've decided to focus on Health Technology which contains a lot of **data analysis**, **biosignals** and **machine learning**. I have Materials Engineering minor in my Bachelor's. It has taught me a lot about properties of materials and **Computer Aided Design** especially with Creo. In my Masters's I have a minor in Robotics and Autonomous Systems. It, in turn, has taught me **robotic perception**, **mapping and navigation**, **computer vision and sensor fusion** and how to acquire data from different sensors and convert it for visualization and analysis.

Here you can find some of my academic work mostly done in **Python**. Below I have explained more in detail what you can find and from where. I hope you have fun exploring my awesome codes or that you can find boost to your own coding!

### Academic work

#### EKG sleep apnea detection 🫀📈

This was a project work my friend and I did in our health technology project course. We did two projects on that course and this was my part. We got EKG data and were instructed to detect sleep apnea from it. This was very interesting project on biosignals, HRV metrics, and machine learning we have a lot of in our studies. It was a great opportunity to put my skills to use. Check out our workflow and conclusions!
