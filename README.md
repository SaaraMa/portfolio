## Saara's portfolio
Here is a showcase of my competence. Some skills that I have learned in university and personal projects.

Hi, I'm Saara! I'm a third year Biomedical Engineering and Health Technology student from Turku. I'll complete my Bachelor's Degree in spring 2025 and continue to my Master's Degree. I've already started my Master's by completing around 15 credits by now and will complete another 15 credits before summer. In my Master's I've decided to focus on Health Technology which contains a lot of data analysis, biosignals and machine learning. I have Materials Engineering minor in my Bachelor's. It has taught me a lot about properties of materials and Computer Aided Design especially with Creo.
